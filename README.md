# Dify.ai Showcase: Integrating Custom `e2b.dev` Tool

## Overview

The following outlines the custom integration of `e2b.dev` tools within Dify.ai. This configuration enables a flexible environment for executing scripts with specific pre-configured settings. Below are key parameters essential for using `e2b.dev` within Dify.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Code to Execute
The first parameter is the code itself, representing the complete script or program you intend to run. For example, if you are using Python to solve a computation problem, you would import the necessary Python packages, perform the computation, and then output the results.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Programming Language
The programming language for the code is selectable via a dropdown menu. `e2b.dev` supports several languages, including Python, JavaScript, R, Java, and Bash. In this setup, Python is pre-selected, but it can be changed by modifying the dropdown. Alternatively, you could alter the source code to allow this parameter to be set dynamically rather than predefined.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Template ID
For Python, an essential feature of `e2b.dev` is its ability to preload specific Python packages and package them within different Sandbox environments. You can reference these environments by their Template ID. By specifying the Template ID, users can seamlessly invoke a predefined environment loaded with specific packages.

- Documentation for initializing a sandbox template: [Initialize Sandbox Template](https://e2b.dev/docs/sandbox-template#2-initialize-sandbox-template)
- For installing custom Python packages during runtime, refer to: [Install Packages During Sandbox Runtime](https://e2b.dev/docs/quickstart/install-custom-packages#install-packages-during-the-sandbox-runtime)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Flexibility with Environment Specification
One advantage of using Template IDs to specify environments is that it allows users to switch environments without needing to modify Dify‚Äôs Source Code for each Python package. This setup is particularly useful for users who may require flexibility in environment specification across different machines, as they can simply use the API key and Template ID for similar results. This approach may offer more flexibility than Dify‚Äôs native Sandbox but requires more maintenance for source code compatibility with Dify. Ideally, future improvements could include simplified user-defined Tool integrations within Dify.

### Note
The showcased code here is experimental and was fully generated by [Claude.ai](http://Claude.ai). Many thanks to it for the contribution. üôè
